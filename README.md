Basic Graphical Calendar Project

This is a basic graphical calendar project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar is designed with separate elements for the date, month, and year, each linked to the JavaScript code for real-time updates. It's my second attempt at using these technologies, and I followed a YouTube tutorial to create it.
